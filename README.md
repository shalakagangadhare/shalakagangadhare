Hello! I’m Shalaka Gangadhare, a motivated and detail-oriented Data Science Intern at HH Tech Company, with a strong foundation in analytics and a passion for solving real-world problems using data.

🎓 I hold a BE degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from Pune University.
🛒 I bring several years of practical experience in supply chain management through my self-run, government-certified ration store business. This has given me a deep understanding of operations, logistics, and customer behavior at a ground level.

To transition into the data field, I recently completed a comprehensive Data Science Bootcamp at Odin School, where I built hands-on expertise in:

🐍 Python

💾 SQL

🤖 Machine Learning

📊 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI)

Through multiple projects, I applied these skills to real datasets—performing data cleaning, EDA, predictive modeling, and dashboard creation.

💡 I am passionate about using data to drive decisions and improve processes. My unique blend of business experience and technical skills enables me to approach problems with both analytical and practical perspectives.

📌 I’m actively looking to grow in the field of data science and analytics, and I'm excited to contribute to innovative teams.
